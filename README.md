💰 Financial & Customer Insights Dashboard
A dynamic and strategic business intelligence project designed to analyze core financial performance, monitor profitability, and explore customer demographics and behavior.

🎯 Short Description / Purpose
This Power BI dashboard provides a holistic view of a business's financial health and the characteristics of its customer base. It enables finance teams and marketing strategists to track key metrics like revenue, operational costs, customer acquisition costs, and retention rates to inform budget planning, marketing investments, and overall business strategy.

🛠️ Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following core tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – The primary platform used for data modeling, visualization design, and report creation.

📂 Power Query (M Language) – Used for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation (e.g., consolidating transaction records and harmonizing customer data).

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Employed for creating crucial analytical measures and KPIs, such as Gross Profit Margin, Customer Churn Rate, Return on Investment (ROI), and Period-over-Period comparisons.

📝 Data Modeling – Established relationships between financial ledger data, transaction tables, and customer information records to ensure accurate, unified reporting.

📁 File Format – Developed as a Power BI Report file (.pbix).

💾 Data Source
The project uses integrated financial and customer relationship management data.

Source: Consolidated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems (Hypothetical)

Data Content: The dataset is assumed to integrate information from:

Financial Metrics: Revenue, COGS, Expenses, and Profit across various business units.

Customer Metrics: Demographics, acquisition channel, transaction history, and support tickets.

Time & Geography: Transaction dates and regional market codes.

✨ Features / Highlights
The primary goal of this dashboard is to bridge the gap between financial results and the customer actions that drive them.

Business Problem: Financial results often report what happened (e.g., profit decreased), but often fail to visually link this to why (e.g., a specific segment of customers stopped buying). This dashboard solves that by linking the two datasets.

Goal of the Dashboard: To provide an intuitive, drill-down environment that connects revenue metrics directly to customer behavior, allowing users to:

Determine the profitability of different customer segments.

Forecast cash flow based on historical transaction patterns.

Evaluate the success and cost-effectiveness of marketing channels.

Walkthrough of Key Visuals (Hypothetical)
Key Financial KPIs: Highlighting Total Profit, Gross Revenue, and Operating Expense Ratio for the current period.

Monthly Revenue Trend (Line Chart): Tracking historical revenue performance with year-over-year comparison and anomaly detection.

Profitability by Segment (Bar Chart): Ranks product lines, service tiers, or regional teams based on their gross profit margin.

Customer Acquisition Funnel: Visualizing the conversion rate from leads to active paying customers by marketing channel.

Customer Demographics Map: A map showing the density and spending power of customers across different geographic areas.

Business Impact & Insights

Marketing Optimization: Identify which customer acquisition channels deliver the highest CLV and return on marketing spend.
